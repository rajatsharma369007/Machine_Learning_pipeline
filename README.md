# Introduction
This repository will help you create a Machine Learning Pipeline from scratch with the help of these example notebooks. Machine Learning pipelines help automate a Machine Learning workflow.

# Notebooks
* [Clean and Tokenize](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Machine_Learning_pipeline/blob/master/clean_tokenize.ipynb)
* [Machine Learning Workflow](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Machine_Learning_pipeline/blob/master/ml_workflow.ipynb)
* [Pipelines](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Machine_Learning_pipeline/blob/master/pipeline.ipynb)
* [Custom Transformers](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Machine_Learning_pipeline/blob/master/custom_transformer.ipynb)
* [Grid Search complete ML pipeline](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Machine_Learning_pipeline/blob/master/grid_search.ipynb)

# Issues
Please open issues on github to report bugs or error or any optimisation you want to share.

# Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open the issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
